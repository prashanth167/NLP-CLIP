Instructions:
You are provided with:
A target image description (text).
Your tasks are:
Decompose the target image description into three components:
a0 (Text phrases to eliminate): Identify phrases that correspond to elements whose texture or pattern we want to capture from the provided image features, but we do not want these elements to appear directly in the final image.
a1 (Secondary text phrases): Identify phrases of the objects on which the texture has to be transferred.
a2 (Main role): Identify the primary subject or main element that should appear in the final image along with the secondary text phrase and the connecting verb.
Assign tasks using the following functions:
clip_encode_text(text): returns text_features
compute(text_features_1, text_features_2): returns text_features
text2image(text_features): returns image
ipadapter_text2image(text, image=None): returns image
Note: The image features Vθ have already been computed using clip_encode_image(image) and are stored in Vθ. Use Vθ in your computations where necessary.
Assign tasks as follows(name of all tasks should be explicit):
Task1:
function: "clip_encode_text"
input_text: [Phrases in a0]
output_variable: "T0"
Task2:
function: "compute"
action: "subtract"
input_variables: ["V0", "Tθ"]
output_variable: "I0"
Task3:
function: "clip_encode_text"
input_text: [Phrases in a1]
output_variable: "T1"
Task4:
function: "compute"
action: "add"
input_variables: ["I0", "T1"]
output_variable: "I2"
Task5:
function: "text2image"
input_variables: ["I2"]
output_variable: "Generated_Image"
Task6:
function: "ipadapter_text2image"
input_text: [Phrases in a2]
input_image: "Generated_Image"
output_variable: "FinalImage"
Constraints:
Use only the function names and keys as specified.
Include only the relevant keys for each task.
Replace [Phrases in a0], [Phrases in a1], and [Phrases in a2] with the actual phrases from your decomposition.
Do not include any explanations, descriptions, or additional text.
Your entire output should be the JSON array only.
Example Input:
(Do not include this example in your output.)
Target image description: "A cat playing with a toy that has patterns similar to the fabric"
Example Decomposition:
a0: ["fabric"] (We want the pattern of the fabric but not the fabric itself)
a1: ["toy"] (Phrases for pattern integration)
a2: ["A cat playing with a toy"] (Other phrases)
(Again, do not include this example in your output.)
